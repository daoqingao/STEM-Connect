# STEM Connect - Waffle Hacks 2021 Project

## What is STEM Connect?

STEM Connect was developed by a group of students studying Computer Science
at Stony Brook University. Having all been part of the education and technology industry, 
we sought to create a platform where educators can promote their services to students across 
the world. We believe that STEM Connect can help promote small businesses in education, bring more 
diversity to STEM fields, and connect more educators with students across the globe.

Educators now have a platform to promote their services to students across the world. 
Whether you are a small tutor or a university, you can promote your programs on STEM Connect. 
If you are a student, you now have access to a variety of programs where you can sharpen your skills in STEM fields.

## Inspiration

As former teaching assistants and computer science instructors, 
we've noticed that a lot of individual tutors and small businesses in 
education aren't getting the amount of outreach that they should be getting. 
Some amazing programs are simply not heard of and many students are missing out on the opportunity to learn. 
We wanted to create a platform to help promote these small programs which will in turn help add 
more to the STEM field and help support small businesses in education.

## How to use (Students)
If you are a student, you now have access to a variety of resources in the STEM field. Navigate over to the programs page,
and then you can see all the programs available to you. Click on the ones you would like to register for and follow the steps
on the page. You are now ready to get learning!

## How to use (Educators)
If you are an educator, STEM Connect is the place for you to post your amazing services and programs to students. 
After creating an account and signing in, you can start making posts for your programs. 
Fill out all the necessary information such as title, cost, description, and etc. and you 
have just made a post for students to see. Now just sit back and prepare for students to register!
